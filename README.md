# **PROG**

Minimalistic arena-style PvP-game with a click-to-move control scheme and an emphasis on mouse-aim precision and predicting the movements of your opponent(s).

The main goal of this project is to try and fill the void of isometric combat in a style similar to that in _Conquer Online 2.0_ as I knew it before the addition of the 131+ levels and additional classes (Ninjas and Pirates and whatever else) which happened around 2008.

The project is Open Source under the AGPLv3 for the ultimate end-user freedom experience. Contribute or fork to your hearts desire for the benefit of those who wants to see this reach its full potential.

The project is in heavy flux and core code is being rewritten all the time (well.. when I _have_ time). As such, changes will break things and the game will go through several iterations to see what works and what doesn't.

Don't hesitate to contribute with ideas or code. Contributing code is a little awkward at the moment because the project uses an unstable build of the Godot Engine because the multiplayer rewrite demands some very recently implemented features which have not yet been added to the stable version (and likely won't until 3.0), and the master branch of Godot is right now in an even more unstable state, so I would recommend finding a dev-build from november last year.

**Roadmap:**

Mainly, what's being worked on now is getting a functional multiplayer mode working, with bots included. The entire code base, more or less, is being rewritten to accomodate this and other goals.
